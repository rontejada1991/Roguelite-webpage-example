		<h2 class="content_title">What are roguelike games?</h2>
		
		<h3>For a game to be considered roguelike, they need to process most of these qualities:</h3>
		
		<ul>
			<li>Randomly generated room layouts with every new game.</li>
			<li>Randomly generated items with every new game. Items will often have vague descriptions on their capabilities.</li>
			<li>A turn-based combat system.</li>
			<li>Single-player focused. Some games have implemented a leaderboard system.</li>
			<li>Once a character dies, the player must begin a new game. Also known as permadeath.</li>
		</ul>
			
		<h2 class="content_title">What are hybrid roguelike / roguelike-like / rogue-lite games anyway?</h2>
		
		<h3 >These games inherit a few mechanics often found in roguelike games but also inject their own flavor to create unique experiences.</h3>
